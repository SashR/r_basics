## Week 1
### data types -- Matrices
Matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute. The dimension attribute
is itself an integer vector (nrow, ncol)
Matrices can be created via the matrix function.Values can be instantiated here,
they are inserted by column first

A matrix can also be created by creating the dimension attribute on a vector.
We saying we want to change this vector into a matrix of n cols and m rows.

```
m <- matrix(start:end,nrow = 2, ncol = 4)

m <- 1:6
dim(m) <- c(2,3)
```

Another way to create a matrix is by binding cols/rows via cbind/rbind
```
x<-3:5
y<-10:13
cbind(x, y)
rbind(x, y)
```
