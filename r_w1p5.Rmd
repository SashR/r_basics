## week 1 (part 5.1)
### Subsetting - Basics

There are a number of operators that can be used to extract subsets of R objects:

* [ always returns an object of the same class as the original; can be used to select more than one element (there is one exception) (covered later)
* [[ is used to extract elements of a list or data frame; it can only be used to extract a single element and the class of the returned object will not necessarily be a list or a data frame.
* $ is used to extract elements of a list or a data frame by name; semantics are similar to that of [[

```{r}
xa <- c("a", "b", "c", "c", "d", "a")
xa[1]
xa[2]
xa[1:4]
xa[xa > "a"]
u <- xa > "a"
u
xa[u]
```
