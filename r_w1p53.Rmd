### Subsetting - Matrices
Matrices can be subsetted in the usual way with (i,j) type indices:
```{r}
xm1 <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
xm1
xm1[1,2]
xm1[2,1]
```
Indices can also be missing:
```{r}
xm2 <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
xm2
xm2[1,] # first row returns a vector
xm2[,2] # second col returns vector
```

By default, when a single element of a matrix is retrieved,  it is returned as a vector of length 1 rather a 1x1 matrix. This behavior can be turned off by setting *drop* = false. *drop* drops the dimension:
```{r}
xm3 <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
xm3
xm3[1,2, drop = FALSE]
```

Similarly, subsetting a single column or a single row will give you a vector, not a matrix (by default):
```{r}
xm4 <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
xm4
xm4[1, , drop = FALSE]
```
