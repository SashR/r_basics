### Data Frames
This is a key data type in R. It is used to store tabular data.It is very
important
- They are represented as a special type of list, where every element of the
list has to have the same length
- Each element of the list can be thought of as a column and the length
of the list is the number of rows.
- Unlike matrices, data frames can store different classes of objects in each
column (like lists) (matrices must have every element be the same class)
- Data Frames also have a special attribute called row.names
- Data Frames are usually created by called read.table() or read.csv()
- Can be converted to a matrix by calling data.matrix()

```{r data frame}
df <- data.frame(foo = 1:4, bar = c(T,T,F,F))
df
nrow(df)
ncol(df)
```
